                <h2 class="text-success">What is NIDS?</h2>
                <p>Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) monitor network traffic for signs of suspicious activity or policy violations. Their goal is to detect threats and alert administrators before significant damage is done.Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are critical components of modern network security, helping to detect and alert on potential attacks or policy violations. They can be deployed on individual hosts or across an entire network, and they play a vital role in providing early warnings and helping to mitigate security threats. While IDS systems are not foolproof and have limitations, they are essential tools in an organizationâ€™s overall cybersecurity strategy.</p>

                <h2 class="text-warning">How Machine Learning Helps</h2>
                <p>Machine learning algorithms enhance the capabilities of NIDS by automating threat detection. With historical data, these models learn to classify traffic as normal or anomalous, minimizing false alarms and increasing accuracy.</p>

                <h2 class="text-info">Our Approach</h2>
                <p>We leverage advanced machine learning models such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Networks to detect network intrusions. These models are trained on large datasets containing various attack and normal traffic patterns.Random Forest is a powerful and widely used machine learning algorithm for both classification and regression tasks. It belongs to the family of ensemble learning methods, which combine multiple individual models to create a more robust, accurate model. Random Forest is based on the concept of decision trees, and it builds a forest of decision trees to make predictions.</p>
